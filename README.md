## Hello and welcome.

This is the repository of my website. I have planned a portfolio for a long time and finally I started it.
Initially I was using Bootstrap, but it was not working for what I wanted to do. I was trying to create a
structure using the Golden Ratio, but it was quite confusing to implement and I though that it would be hard 
to maintain. So, I decided to do everything by myself, with no frameworks for the interface, and 
I started to use media queries. It was quite a challenge to make it responsive in the way that I wanted, 
but definitely I learned much more.

The main page retrieves data from the database to display the projects, while the other pages are static. I developed it
using ASP.NET MVC, Razor, HTML, CSS, and SQL. My next plans involve refactoring of the CSS using the modular approach 
described in the book "Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS" of Jonathan Snook and improve the main page.
